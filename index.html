<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
As our world becomes increasingly connected and dependent on the internet, 
I wanted to learn more about how it all fit together, so I decided to learn to become
a web developer. It's challenging but rewarding to peak behind the curtain and learn how these
things work. 
</p>
<p>
When I'm not working on code, I love cheering on the Indians, Cavs, and (painfully)
even the Browns. I'm also a big fan of running, as I find it's a great way to stay 
healthy and relieve stress. I've completed 4 half marathons and hope to run more 
in the future.
